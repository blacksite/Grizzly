Calculate the max and min value for features from malicious instances during training
The Detector randomly generates two values between the min and max value for a given feature
All features with maxes above 0.0 were considered
The lesser value is the lower bound and the larger value is the upper bound for the feature
If a given feature's maximum value is 0.0, then the bounds for that given feature in the detector are both 0.0
The best r-value for the detectors was determined by iterating through all possible r-value [1..76] and finding which r-value
performed best on the training set. The training consists of all folds not used in the test set.
