Calculate the max and min value for features from malicious instances during training
The Detector randomly generates two values between the min and max value for a given feature
The lesser value is the lower bound and the larger value is the upper bound for the feature
If a given feature's maximum value is 0.0, then the bounds for that given feature in the detector are both 0.0
