Calculate the max and min value for features from each type of malicious instances during training
A DNN is trained and tested on each type of malicious instance
A detector set is trained and tested for each type of malicious instance
A given detector set consists of detectors, which are randomly generated
The Detector randomly generates two values between the min and max value for a given feature of a particular type of malicious instance
All features with maxes above 0.0 were considered
The lesser value is the lower bound and the larger value is the upper bound for the feature
If a given feature's maximum value is 0.0, then the bounds for that given feature in the detector are both 0.0
The best r-value for the generated detector set was determined by iterating through all possible r-value [1..76] and finding which r-value
performed best on the training set. The training consists of all folds not used in the test set.
The detector set and best r-value are then evaluated on the test set to find accuracy
This process is repeated for each fold
The entire process is then repeated for each type of malicious instance
